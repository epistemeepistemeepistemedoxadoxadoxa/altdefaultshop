      <h1>
        In the past few months, <a href="https://haggi.info/">Park West New York, New York</a> has developed a
        series of tools that can be used to create vectors for typography and
        illustration as well as page layouts and video. Documentation of this
        process has mainly been through screenshots and screen recordings. The
        programs have led to many outcomes, some of which can’t be transformed
        into .otf or .ttf font files. I’ve decided to share some images captured
        during the development process to help explain what the tools are
        capable of and how I’ve been using them.<br><br>

        A demo of an early version of a simple brush tool is available <a href="https://haggi.info/">here</a>.

        Join the mailing list for updates on when<br>
        the software will be made available.
